#The Random Movie Generator

http://mmmfang.github.io/api-movie-grabber/

Used: Javascript, JQuery, external API, CSS, HTML

This is my first time using an API - OMDB for its movie data. The generator will display movies with movie posters which are clickable to its IMDB page. I added a CSS animation to the h1.

Please note I believe the number of requests that can be made to IMDB server is very limited, so pictures may return blank if limit is exceeded. The site is live for examples sake!
